      I like to watch videos about fishing on youtube during freetime. Since the beginning of quarantine I have not been fishing, which led to watching different videos about it. Most of the time I use instagram and imess to communicate with my families and friends, but sometimes we use gmail too. I sometimes use a camera app to take pictures of my hamster.
